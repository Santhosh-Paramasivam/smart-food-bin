# Smart Food Donation Bins

## Problem

Food banks, pantries and soup kitchens all over the world carry out the necessary work of providing food to the increasing number of food-insecure people. However, due to a lack of resources, monetary and otherwise, these vital organizations are struggling to organize food for everyone.

Many people who can donate food or the ingredients for preparing don't because of having to travel, and food banks have to expend significant monetary resources for donation pickups.

## Solution
